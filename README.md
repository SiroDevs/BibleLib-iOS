## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Android Studio** Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer
- **JDK 17** — required by the `build-logic` convention plugins
- **Android SDK** with API 26–37 installed (the SDK Manager inside Android Studio handles this)

## Architecture overview

### Module graph

Feature modules depend only on `core` modules and never on each other. All cross-feature navigation
lives in `app`.

```
app
 ├── core:common
 ├── core:data          → core:database, core:network, core:common
 ├── core:design_system
 ├── core:ui             → core:common, core:data, core:design_system
 └── feature:*           → core:common, core:data, core:database, core:design_system, core:ui
```

### Core modules

**`core:common`** — pure Kotlin/Parcelize. Holds `Routes` (all navigation route strings, including
argument encoding for the reader and payment WebView), `ApiConstants`, `PrefConstants`, `AppFonts`,
`UiState` (sealed interface: `Loading`, `Loaded`, `Saving`, `Saved`, `Error`), shared data classes (
`BibleInfo`, `BibleBook`, `BibleChapter`, `VerseDisplay`, `ReadingHistory`, `SearchResult`), and
`NetworkUtils`.

**`core:data`** — all data-access logic sitting above the DB and network layers:

- `PrefsRepo` — a strongly typed `SharedPreferences` wrapper covering install date, selected/primary
  Bible, last-read position, theme mode, font size timestamp, last-sync timestamp, and
  `resetAppData()` for clearing selection state.
- `ThemeRepo` — a `@HiltViewModel` that exposes the current `ThemeMode` (`SYSTEM` / `LIGHT` /
  `DARK`) as Compose state and persists changes via `PrefsRepo`.
- `BibleRepo` — fetches available Bibles, books, chapters, and verses from the BibleLib content API,
  parses the nested verse-content JSON into flat `VerseDisplay` lists, and persists everything to
  Room. Also serves local reads and in-database verse search.
- `TrackingRepo` — records reading history and search-query history to Room, pruning old entries.
- `DonationRepo` — initializes a Paystack transaction (amount, donor email/name, callback URL) and
  returns the authorization URL for the in-app WebView checkout.
- `SyncWorker` / `BibleSyncWorkerFactory` / `SyncScheduler` — a Hilt-integrated `CoroutineWorker`
  that downloads a secondary Bible translation in the background with a foreground progress
  notification, scheduled via WorkManager with network constraints and exponential backoff.

**`core:database`** — Room database (`AppDatabase`, version 4) with six entities: `BibleEntity`,
`BookEntity`, `ChapterEntity`, `VerseEntity`, `HistoryEntity`, `SearchEntity`, and their DAOs.

**`core:network`** — `NetworkModule` (Hilt) wires up two Retrofit instances: one for the BibleLib
content API (`BibleLibService`, serving `info.json`, `books.json`, `chapters.json`, and per-book
verse JSON) and one for the Paystack API (`PaystackService`, transaction initialization).

**`core:design_system`** — Material 3 theme, colour palette, and typography scale.

**`core:ui`** — `MainViewModel` (determines the app's start destination) plus shared Compose
components: `AppTopBar`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`, loading indicators, `DonationBanner`,
`AppDialogs`, auto-sizing text utilities, `PageCurlEffect`, `CornerNavZone`, and
`ThemeSelectorDialog`.

### Feature modules

| Module              | Screens                                                                         | ViewModels           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `feature:selection` | Bible selection (first launch or re-selection)                                  | `SelectionViewModel` |
| `feature:reader`    | Chapter reader (book drawer, chapter nav bar, verse list, Bible selector sheet) | `ReaderViewModel`    |
| `feature:search`    | Verse search, recent search history                                             | `SearchViewModel`    |
| `feature:history`   | Reading history                                                                 | `HistoryViewModel`   |
| `feature:settings`  | Theme and font-size settings                                                    | `SettingsViewModel`  |
| `feature:help`      | Help                                                                            | —                    |

All ViewModels are `@HiltViewModel`-annotated and follow the same pattern: `StateFlow` for UI
state (observed with `collectAsState()` in the composable), coroutines on `viewModelScope` doing
database/network work on `Dispatchers.IO`.

### Navigation

Navigation is handled by a single `NavHostController` in `AppNavHost.kt` at the `app` level. Route
strings are constants in `Routes` (`core:common`); the reader route carries `bibleAbbr`, `bookId`,
and `chapterId` as query arguments, and the payment WebView route carries a URL-encoded redirect
URL.

`MainViewModel` determines the start destination at launch by reading `PrefsRepo`: if the user
hasn't completed Bible selection (or asked to re-select), it routes to `SELECTION`; otherwise it
routes straight to `READER`.

```
SELECTION ──► READER ──┬──► SEARCH
                        ├──► HISTORY
                        ├──► SETTINGS
                        └──► HELP
```

### Data flow and downloads

When a user selects a Bible in `feature:selection`, `BibleRepo.downloadBible()` runs the full fetch
pipeline: books → chapters → verses (per book), converting the API's nested verse-content JSON into
flat `VerseDisplay` rows and writing everything to Room. Selecting a second (secondary) translation
later schedules the same download as a background job — `SyncScheduler.scheduleSecondaryDownload()`
enqueues `SyncWorker` via WorkManager with a network constraint, exponential backoff, and a
foreground notification that reports per-book download progress.

Once a translation is downloaded, `feature:reader` reads purely from Room — no network calls are
needed to read, browse, or search within an already-downloaded Bible.

---

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SiroDevs/BibleLib.git
cd BibleLib
```

### 2. Run the app

Open the project in Android Studio. Gradle sync will run automatically. Once it completes, select
the `debug` build variant and run the `app` configuration on a device or emulator running API 26 or
higher.

```bash
# Or from the command line:
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

The `debug` build variant uses the application ID `com.biblelib.dev`, so it installs alongside a
production build without conflict.

On first launch the app walks through Bible selection, then downloads the chosen translation(s) from
the live content API. You need a network connection for this initial download — after that, reading,
browsing, and searching that translation work fully offline.

### 3. Release builds (optional)

Release signing is configured in `app/build.gradle.kts` and reads from a `keystore/key.properties`
file. This is only needed if you are cutting a release build — **not required for development or
contributing**.

Create `keystore/key.properties` at the project root:

```properties
storeFile=../keystore/release.jks
storePassword=your_store_password
keyAlias=your_key_alias
keyPassword=your_key_password
```

Then build:

```bash
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease    # AAB for Play Store
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease  # APK for direct install
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch off `develop`.
2. New screens belong in a `feature` module. If you're adding a genuinely new section of the app,
   create a new feature module following the same `build.gradle.kts` structure as the existing ones.
3. Shared UI components go in `core:ui`. Logic that multiple features need goes in a repository in
   `core:data`.
4. All ViewModels must be `@HiltViewModel`-annotated. All repositories must be `@Singleton`-scoped.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description and reference any related issue.
